- Memory system and learning patterns
- Command definitions (/icc-* equivalents)
- Configuration hierarchy and settings

## Success Criteria
- Users can run same behavioral patterns on Gemini CLI
- Role assignments and collaboration work identically
- PRB creation and execution functions seamlessly
- Memory captures and applies learnings effectively
