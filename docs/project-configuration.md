## Using Project Configuration

### 1. Best Practices Inclusion
When PRBs are generated, they automatically include:
- Relevant best practices from your project
- Architecture patterns and constraints
- Coding standards and style guides

### 2. Code Pattern Search
The system searches your codebase for:
- Similar implementations
- Existing patterns to follow
- Examples to reference

### 3. External Documentation
PRBs can reference:
- Real-time library documentation via Context7
- Project-specific documentation URLs
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

### 4. Behavioral Customization
Each project can override default behaviors:
- How errors are handled
- Testing methodology
- Code review depth
- Validation criteria

## Draft-Based PRB Generation

Place draft specifications wherever natural in your project:

```bash
# Create draft directory in your preferred location
mkdir -p drafts/new-feature/
# OR
mkdir -p docs/drafts/new-feature/
# OR
mkdir -p specs/new-feature/

# Add specifications
echo "User Authentication Requirements..." > drafts/new-feature/requirements.md

# Generate PRBs from drafts
/icc-generate-prb-from-draft drafts/new-feature/
```

The system will:
1. @PM analyzes requirements
2. @Architect designs approach
3. Generate appropriate PRBs with all project context
4. Include best practices and standards
5. Reference existing code patterns

## Dynamic Configuration

PRBs adapt to your project:
- **React Project**: Includes React best practices, component patterns
- **Terraform Project**: Includes IaC standards, module patterns  
- **API Project**: Includes RESTful patterns, OpenAPI specs
- **Microservices**: Includes service boundaries, communication patterns

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All work follows project standards
2. **Knowledge Reuse**: Leverages existing patterns
3. **Quality**: Enforces best practices automatically
4. **Flexibility**: Fully configurable per project
5. **Autonomy**: PRBs contain everything needed for execution
