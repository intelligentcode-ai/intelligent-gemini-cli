## Key Concepts

### Virtual Team
14 specialist roles with deep expertise:
- Leadership: @PM, @Architect
- Development: @Developer, @AI-Engineer, @Database-Engineer
- Quality: @QA-Engineer, @Security-Engineer, @Backend-Tester
- Operations: @System-Engineer, @DevOps-Engineer
- Design: @Web-Designer, @Requirements-Engineer

### PRBs (Product Requirement Blueprints)
Self-contained execution blueprints that include:
- Complete requirements
- Your coding standards
- Relevant code examples
- Previous learnings
- Validation criteria

### Memory System
Version-controlled learning storage:
- Topic-based organization (authentication/, performance/, etc.)
- Shared with team via git
- Auto-embedded in PRBs
- Token-efficient (max 5KB per file)

### Autonomy Levels
- **L1**: Manual approval for everything
- **L2**: Architect approval for technical decisions (default)
- **L3**: Fully autonomous operation

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
/icc-init-system              # Start here
/icc-create-prb "task"        # Generate blueprint
/icc-think-sequential "problem" # Solve complex problems
/icc-store-memory topic "learning" # Save knowledge
```
