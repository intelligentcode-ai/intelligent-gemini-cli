# Progress Reporting

**MANDATORY:** Use clean, professional progress reporting. Auto-correct gamification violations.

**PURPOSE:** Replace badges/scoring with clean completion tracking focused on reliability

## Core Principles

**Professional Execution:**
- Focus on work completion, not achievement points
- Clear progress indicators throughout PRB execution  
- Memory pattern application tracking
- Simple success/failure reporting

**Progress Indicators:**
- "PRB-XXX: Executing [stage]"
- "Memory patterns applied: [count]" 
- "PRB-XXX: Completed successfully"
- "Learning captured: [patterns]"

## Reporting Format

### PRB Execution Progress
```
🔄 PRB-001: Analyzing requirements
🔄 PRB-001: Applying memory patterns (3 found)
🔄 PRB-001: Implementing solution
✅ PRB-001: Completed successfully
📚 Learning: 2 new patterns captured in memory/
```

### Memory Integration
```
🧠 Applied previous learning: "Authentication error handling"
🧠 Pattern matched: memory/errors/auth-timeout.md
🧠 New pattern created: memory/patterns/oauth2-refresh.md
```

### Role Execution
```
@Developer: Task initiated
@Developer: Requirements analyzed, implementation starting
@Developer: Solution implemented, testing complete
@Developer: Task completed successfully
```

## Integration Points

### With PRB System
- Progress updates at each PRB section
- Memory search and application reporting
- Clean completion validation
- Learning capture confirmation

### With Memory System
- Report patterns found and applied
- Document new learnings created
- Track knowledge utilization statistics
- Professional learning summaries

### With Role System  
- Simple role activation notices
- Clean task completion reporting
- Focus on work delivery, not performance scoring
- Professional specialist behavior

## Replacement Patterns

### Instead of Badges/Scoring:
- **Old:** "🚀 Deliverer badge earned (+2.0P bonus)"
- **New:** "Task completed successfully"

- **Old:** "@Role (P:8.5, Q:9.2): Implementation complete"  
- **New:** "@Role: Implementation complete"

- **Old:** "+0.5P bonus for learning application"
- **New:** "Applied memory pattern: [pattern-name]"

### Focus Areas:
1. **Reliability:** System works predictably
2. **Professionalism:** Clean, tool-like behavior  
3. **Learning:** Memory patterns drive improvement
4. **Completion:** Clear success/failure indicators

## Error Reporting

**Simple, Actionable:**
- "❌ PRB-001: Failed at implementation stage"
- "🔄 Retrying with memory pattern: [pattern-name]"
- "✅ Recovery successful using: [recovery-method]"
- "📚 Error pattern captured for future prevention"

**No Penalties or Scores:**
- Focus on fixing problems, not assigning blame
- Learn from errors without gamification
- Professional error handling and recovery
- Clear next steps for resolution
