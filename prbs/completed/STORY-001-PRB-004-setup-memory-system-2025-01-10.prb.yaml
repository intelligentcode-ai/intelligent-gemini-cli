title: "Setup Memory System for Gemini CLI"
complexity: "tiny"
parent_story: "STORY-001"

complete_context:
  system_nature: "MARKDOWN-BASED AI-AGENTIC SYSTEM"
  project_root: "/Users/ksamaschke/Work/Engineering/intelligent-gemini-cli-project/intelligent-gemini-cli"
  source_memory: "/Users/ksamaschke/Work/Engineering/intelligent-claude-code/memory"
  configuration:
    memory_system: "file-based"
    storage_format: "markdown"
  user_requirements:
    original_request: "Setup memory system for learning capture and retrieval"
    success_criteria:
      - "Memory directory structure created"
      - "Learning storage functional"
      - "Memory integration commands work"

functional_requirements:
  - Create memory/ directory with topic-based organization
  - Copy existing memory patterns from source system
  - Create memory integration commands (search, store, apply)
  - Test memory retrieval in Gemini CLI context

technical_requirements:
  - Same file structure as Intelligent Claude Code memory system
  - Markdown format for all memory entries
  - Topic-based organization (memory/[topic]/[subtopic].md)
  - Compatible with Gemini's file reading capabilities

processual_requirements:
  - Verify memory files copy correctly
  - Test memory search functionality
  - Document memory organization patterns
  - Create examples of memory usage

role_assignment:
  assigned_role: "@Developer"
  rationale: "Memory system setup requires file operations and testing"

git_operations:
  - stage: "Add memory directory structure and content"
  - commit: "feat: Setup memory system for Gemini CLI"
  - push: true

knowledge_management:
  capture_learnings: true
  memory_location: "memory/system-setup/memory-system.md"
  learning_focus: "Memory system patterns and Gemini integration"

success_criteria:
  - Memory directory structure matches source system
  - Memory files accessible from Gemini CLI
  - Memory integration commands functional
  - Learning capture and retrieval works
