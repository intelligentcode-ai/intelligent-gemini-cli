complexity: "medium"
parent_story: "STORY-001"

complete_context:
  system_nature: "MARKDOWN-BASED AI-AGENTIC SYSTEM"
  project_root: "/Users/ksamaschke/Work/Engineering/intelligent-gemini-cli-project/intelligent-gemini-cli"
  reference_system: "/Users/ksamaschke/Work/Engineering/intelligent-claude-code"
  configuration:
    installer_type: "Make + Ansible"
    target_directory: "~/.gemini"
  user_requirements:
    original_request: "Create installation system with Makefile and Ansible playbooks"
    success_criteria:
      - "Makefile with install/uninstall targets"
      - "Ansible playbook for installation"
      - "Compatible with Gemini CLI structure"

functional_requirements:
  - Create Makefile with standard targets (install, uninstall, update, test)
  - Create ansible/playbook.yml for main installation
  - Copy behavioral patterns to ~/.gemini/
  - Setup GEMINI.md with imports
  - Setup commands in ~/.gemini/commands/

technical_requirements:
  - Makefile calls Ansible playbook
  - Idempotent installation (can run multiple times)
  - Check for prerequisites (Node.js, npm, Gemini CLI)
  - Backup existing configuration if present
  - Support both global and project-level installation

processual_requirements:
  - Test installation on clean system
  - Test idempotency with multiple runs
  - Document installation process
  - Create uninstall that preserves user data

role_assignment:
  assigned_role: "@DevOps-Engineer"
  rationale: "Installation system requires DevOps and Ansible expertise"

git_operations:
  - stage: "Add Makefile and Ansible playbooks"
  - commit: "feat: Create installation system with Make and Ansible"
  - push: true

knowledge_management:
  capture_learnings: true
  memory_location: "memory/installation/ansible-setup.md"
  learning_focus: "Porting Make/Ansible installation from Claude to Gemini"

success_criteria:
  - make install successfully installs complete system
  - Ansible playbook is idempotent
  - All components properly installed to ~/.gemini/
  - Gemini CLI recognizes installed components
